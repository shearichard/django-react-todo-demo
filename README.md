# Using Next.js or React with Django

## Motivation

This project is intended for use in workshops etc to demonstrate an 'end-to-end' experience of using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs), on the front end (there is a choice of front ends), and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) on the backend.

## Using OAuth for Authentication

This project is also intended as a demonstrator for the use of [OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/oauth/about/) as an Authentication mechanism, specifically in the context of a Django backend and a React frontend.

## Using the Project

To demonstrate the project in use it's necessary to start both a Django instance and to use the React, or the Next.js, development server. Notes on how to do this are in the associated README linked from below.


- [Django](./README_DJANGO.md)
- [Next](./README_NEXT.md)
