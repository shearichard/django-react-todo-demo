# Next.js Frontend Readme
*Within this project there are two frontends, this one, 'frontendnext', is based on Next.js, the other one, 'frontend', is based on vanilla React.js*

## Testing 

Testing within the Next.js front makes use of the [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) testing framework. The React Testing library , [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is used to support the testing of React components.
